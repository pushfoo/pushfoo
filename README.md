### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I use this account to post things that I work on in my spare time.

#### Skills

I have experience with a variety of subjects including: technical support, QA, documentation, test automation, back-end dev, DevOps, Docker, system administration, assembly, Java, web scraping, and Selenium.

For unpaid volunteer work, I'm currently only up for the first 3 or 4 of those using Python. Due to time constraints, I do those for the projects I care about. You can read more about the projects below!

#### How to reach me
If I haven't already given you an email address to reach me at, you can try reaching me with this username on gmail. 

### Projects

##### Projects I contribute to
* [Arcade](https://github.com/pythonarcade/): A beginner-friendly Python games library that [comes with a reasonable amount of batteries](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html#batteries-included). I write doc, make bug fixes, review code, and occasionally contribute new features.
* [Pyglet](https://github.com/pyglet/pyglet/): An OpenGL binding. I mostly report bugs, fixing some of them.
* [The Pop!\_OS Community](https://github.com/pop-os/): They're doing exciting work in the desktop Linux space! I mostly do volunteer support in their Discord server and occasionally report issues on their github projects.
* [Octo](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Octo) and [c-octo](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/c-octo): My favorite CHIP-8 tools. I used them during [Octojam 8](https://itch.io/jam/octojam-8) to write [Safecracker](https://github.com/pushfoo/Octo-Safecracker).

##### My own projects
* [Safecracker](https://github.com/pushfoo/Octo-Safecracker): A completed code breaking game written in Octo assembly for the XO-CHIP instruction set.
* [EightDAD](https://github.com/pushfoo/eightdad): A CHIP-8 implementation I work on when I have time and interest.
* [pyc2e](https://github.com/pushfoo/pyc2e): A scripting and data transfer binding for the Win32 and Linux versions of the [Creatures Evolution Engine](https://creatures.wiki/Creatures_Evolution_Engine) built around the [ctypes Python module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html). It's unfinished because the community it was initially written for seemed to strongly favor C# and JavaScript.
* [tinytextgamejs](https://github.com/pushfoo/tinytextgamejs): I wrote a text game mini-framework and rock paper scissors implementation to brush up on what recent JavaScript should look like.

I will make additional projects public as I have time to polish them enough for public use.
#### Previously contributed to
* [openc2e](https://github.com/ligfx/openc2e/): A re-implementation of the Creatures Evolution Engine that grew more features over time. I wrote some doc and filed bug reports for it.
* [dstation-2020](https://github.com/Nazushvel/dstation-2020) A likely-obsolete launcher for Creatures Evolution Engine games.
