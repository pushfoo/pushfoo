### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

* Back-end dev

I do some of these for projects I care about. You can read more about those below!

If I haven't already given you an email address to reach me at, you can try reaching me with this username on gmail. 

### Projects

##### Projects I contribute(d) to
* [Arcade](https://github.com/pythonarcade/): A beginner-friendly Python games library that [comes with a reasonable amount of batteries](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html#batteries-included). I write doc, make bug fixes, review code, and occasionally contribute new features.
* [Pyglet](https://github.com/pyglet/pyglet/): An OpenGL binding. I mostly report bugs, fixing some of them.
* [The Pop!\_OS Community](https://github.com/pop-os/): They're doing exciting work in the desktop linux space! I mostly do volunteer support and occasionally report issues on their github projects.
* [Octo](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Octo) and [c-octo](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/c-octo): My current favorite CHIP-8 tools. I use them for [Octojam](https://itch.io/jam/octojam-8).
* [dstation-2020](https://github.com/Nazushvel/dstation-2020) A likely-obsolete launcher for [Creatures Evolution Engine](https://creatures.wiki/Creatures_Evolution_Engine) games.

##### My own projects
* [Safecracker](https://github.com/pushfoo/Octo-Safecracker): A code breaking game written in Octo assembly for the XO-CHIP extended CHIP-8 instruction set.
* [EightDAD](https://github.com/pushfoo/eightdad): A CHIP-8 implementation I work on when I have time and interest.
* [pyc2e](https://github.com/pushfoo/pyc2e): A scripting and data transfer binding for the Win32 and Linux versions of the [Creatures Evolution Engine](https://creatures.wiki/Creatures_Evolution_Engine). The community this was initially written for seemed to favor C# and JavaScript, so this has been a very low priority.
